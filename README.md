# PRODIGY_ML_01
Implementation of a flexible model for home value estimation.

Observations:

Purpose: Estimating house prices based on square meters, number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Dataset: Using the Kaggle "Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset.
Activity: Create recursive models using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Steps:
Data preprocessing: handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Feature Selection: Identify key features that affect real estate value.
Model building: Shows a linear regression model using complete data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using relevant metrics to measure performance.
Publish: Share analysis and predictions.

Knowledge Gained:

Data Pre-Processing: Advanced skills in cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Understand the importance of selecting and engineering the right models.
Modeling: Ability to use Python to implement linear regression models.
Metrics: Learn about metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) used to measure model performance.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand patterns in data.

This project is a part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy Infotech. Thank you for the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems under their guidance!

Come with me on the journey of estimated home prices!Let's improve our skills together.
